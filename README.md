An esoteric programming language, in TypeScript for heaven's sake.

*P.S. Install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=face-hh.bussin) for syntax highlighting!*

# Running
- To run a specific file: `npm run bussin <FILENAME>`
- To run in repl mode (Bussin only): `npm run bussin`

# Bussin
You can find an example at `/examples/main.bs`

# Bussin X ðŸš€
We, at Bussin, believe everyone should be entertained while coding. Meet our alternative: **.bsx**.

Inside **Bussin X**, you *can* use BS syntax, however, it's recommended to use the **BSX** syntax described below. 

## Variables
Mutable variables are created with:
```rs
lit x be 0 rn
```
You can also create a constant variable:
```rs
mf x be 0 rn
```
**Note**: You can only use `rn` on variables.

## Data Strucutres
### Strings
Strings can be created with:
```rs
lit x be "Hello, World!" rn
```
You can also insert variables by using:
```rs
lit x be 0 rn
lit y be strcon("Hello, ", x) rn
```
Or you can format your string to include variables:
```rs
waffle(format("Hello, ${}", "World"))
```
However, you must use your regional currency symbol.
```rs
waffle(format("Hello, ${}", "World"))
waffle(format("Hello, â‚¬{}", "World"))
waffle(format("Hello, Â£{}", "World"))
waffle(format("Hello, Â¥{}", "World"))
```

### Numbers
Numbers are simple:
```rs
lit x be 34 rn
lit y be 12 rn
lit z be x - y rn
```
**Note**: We, at Bussin X, believe decimals are redundant. You can only use positive values too.

### Booleans
Booleans are also simple:
```rs
lit x be nocap rn
lit y be cap rn
```

### Objects
Objects are essential in programming languages. Bussin X supports them too:
```rs
lit x be cap rn
lit obj be { key: nocap, x } rn

obj.key be cap
waffle(obj.key)
```
### Arrays
We, at Bussin X, believe arrays are redundant.
## Comments
We, at Bussin X, believe comments are redundant. Code must be understandable without English.

## Functions
Functions in programming are intricate entities that serve as modular units of code designed to perform specific tasks with a high degree of abstraction and reusability. These multifaceted constructs encapsulate a series of instructions, often comprising algorithmic operations and logical conditions, which execute a well-defined purpose within a larger program. Functionality is delineated through a meticulously crafted signature, encompassing parameters and return types, allowing for parameterization and value transmission between the calling code and the function body. The complexity further burgeons as functions may exhibit a plethora of characteristics, including but not limited to recursion, closures, and the ability to manipulate variables within their designated scopes. Their utility extends beyond mere procedural decomposition, often intertwining with the paradigms of object-oriented, functional, or imperative programming, depending on the programming language employed. The orchestration of functions, with their nuanced interplay, results in the orchestration of intricate software systems, promoting maintainability, readability, and the efficient allocation of computational resources. In essence, functions epitomize the sophisticated essence of programming, embodying the elegance and subtlety required to navigate the intricacies of algorithmic design and software engineering. You can create functions by using:
```rs
bruh perform(x, y) {
    x - y
}
```
We, at Bussin X, think `return` statements are redundant. Instead, our superior functions return the last value emitted.
```rs
bruh perform(x, y) {
    x + y // will do nothing
    x - y
}
```

## If statements
If statements in Bussin X are very intuitive:
```rs
sus (1 fr 1){
    waffle("1 is 1")
} impostor sus (1 nah 2){
    waffle("1 is NOT 2")
} impostor sus (1 fr 3 carenot 1 fr 1){
    waffle("1 is 1 or 3")
} impostor sus (1 fr 3 btw 1 fr 1){
    waffle("1 is 1 and 3. how's that possible hello??")
} impostor {
    waffle("How did we get here?")
}
```

## Loops
Loops in Bussin X are very easy:
```rs
yall(lit i be 0 rn i smol 10 rn i be i + 1){}
```
Because we, at Bussin X, believe programmers should be responsible for their code, we did not add any `break` or `continue` keyword functionality to loops.

## Types
Types in Bussin X are very important!
```rs
lit num: number be 0 rn
```
You can assign types on non-matching values too.
```rs
lit num: object be 0 rn
```
You can also assign types on values themselves.
```rs
lit x be nocap: boolean rn
```
You can assign types on types too.
```rs
lit x: number: number: object: string be 3 rn
```
In fact, you can use types anywhere!
```rs
yall: number(lit: object i: number be 0: object rn i smol 10 rn i be i + 1){
Â  Â  waffle(strcon("Currently at ", i): object)
}: object: object: string
```

**Note**: Types don't do anything, in fact, they're removed before the lexer kicks in.

## Try Catch
Bussin X also supports `try` `catch` statements:
```rs
fuck_around {
    waffle(null + hogrider)
} find_out {
    waffle(error)
}
```
```
Cannot resolve 'hogrider' as it does not exist.
```

**Note**: `find_out` doesn't return anything, "error" is a global variable.

## Extra
### Math
You can utilize the `math` helper by using:
```rs
waffle(nerd.random())
waffle(nerd.sqrt(144))
waffle(nerd.pi)
```
Even though Bussin X doesn't support negative (-) or decimal (.) numbers, we added helper functions for your anxiety:
```rs
waffle(nerd.ceil(3.4))
waffle(nerd.round(3.9))
waffle(nerd.abs(-2))
```

### Time
You can access the current time by using:
```rs
waffle(time())
```

### Command Line
You can run terminal commands by using our **Blazingly Fast** ðŸš€ ClapBack() feature:
```rs
mf res be clapback("ls") rn

waffle(res)
```
**Note**: Clapback will throw an error if failed. Better pair it with `fuck_around` & `find_out`.
```rs
fuck_around {
    lit insult be clapback("rm -rf /") rn

    waffle(insult)
} find_out {
    waffle(error, ":(")
}
```

### New in 1.1.0: yapping
```rs
lit x be yap("watcho name > ") rn
waffle(x)
```
**Note**: The user won't see the text he types, but you will successfully receive the text after the user presses Enter.
